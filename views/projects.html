    <p>As a final project for Grand Circus Front-End Bootcamp, Privy is a bathroom finder and review application. Privy utilizes google maps api to geo-locate the user, and pinpoint the nearest bathrooms. Privy also provides the user with access to the bathroom
        type, location details, and previous user reviews.</p>

        <h3>Biondes</h3>
    </a>
    <p>Biondes is a small locally owned pizza and sub shop. Arguably the best pizza in Detroit, I created them a simple brochure website using mainly basic HTML and CSS. Owner is old-school and classic, so I wanted the site to keep true to what they do and
        their product.</p>
